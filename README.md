# Redux Meteorware
Meteor middleware for Redux

# Why Do I Need This?
This Redux middleware allows us to subscribe and load meteor data through actions and have them returned to the reducers when loaded.

# Motivation
Most of this code was copied from the [my-nutrition](https://github.com/djhi/my-nutrition) project that I was following along with.

# Installation

```
npm install --save redux-meteorware
```
